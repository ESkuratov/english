He   was  has   gone out from the center and he took in the arms something. It was so sudden. I didn't understand what happened.   Later   3 minutes   buyer  later     run  a     seller ran   at him and he shouted that   still  he     stole   gold accessories. I   have  didn't     not  know     known   that   [I need to]   catch   a   shoplifter.
