You are a trainer at a Survival School. Plan a survival course.

What is the course called and what are the aims?
When does it take place and how much is it?
How long is it?
What knowledge and skills will the trainee have obtained after the course?


People think that they live in safe and nothing happened with them.
But we know what break cars and plans. 
every day a lot of people die and get off injuries without wars or floods.
Man must know how survival in critical situations.
He must know what need to do and don't do.
For example, we need to know how to stop bleeding and help when something breaks down.
We can stay alone without food and other things for life. You need to know how to make a trap.
And how to make clothes and stitch material for clothes and a tent.
specialists resign and can teach skills for survival.
I think more people will be interesting and helpful to get a survival course.
