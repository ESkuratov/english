You live in a city next to the park. Some of the trees are going to be cut down because there is no enough sunshine for a plant which is threatened with extinction. You are against (for).

The diversity of flora and fauna in your region.
Why the park is so important for you.
Why it is sensible (not sensible) to cut down some trees.

I don't think that it is a good idea. 
Because if we cut down trees these are the reason for other problems. 
Park is a part urban ecosystem and if we break one part that we break other parts of the ecosystem. 
People need trees for a life in the city because they source clear air and help to relax.
Maybe try to find another solution there is a problem. 
People don't know how to live that doesn't destroy flora and fauna.
