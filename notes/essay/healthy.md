Sometime people don't think what they doing isn't healthy.
it is unhealthy habbits.

I ate a lot of sugar when i was a child.
I very like chocolate and sweets.
I don't think what i ate its it was very unhealthy and need to stick a diet.

I never have smoke beacase i know that it is very bad for my body. 
And drink more alcohol.
Alcohol is so unhelthy younger and older man too. hothere 

I think need tell younge people and childrens about other unhelthy habbits. 
And show what these things is so disgustigly.

Sometime they don't know what it is worse for your body.


Modern world has a lot of things that they tempt us.
Need to have a willpower and rulls.
