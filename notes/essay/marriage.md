People meet and diverge. But sometimes they decide what they want to stay together.
Nowadays it is maybe simple or difficult. But I don't allege it.  
This is simply because it has simple steps. become acquainted than go out with partner and courtship than make sure what you find out each other very well and then you pop the question. Before married you can have hen night or stag night. Many people married at church and walk down the aisle.
Why do people marry? It depends on other reasons.
For example, they in haste or get to know each other and go steady.
Some people never have married because they are confirmed bachelor or an old maid.
In my opinion, you can get to know better and after that, you can hope your life can be better and longer.
