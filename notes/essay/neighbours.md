neighbours

The disagreement is often between neighbors.
They don't share a ground, parking, very noise, and other something.
They accuse each other of their problems.
I don't allege but I think problems in their heads.
First, if you have a bad neighbor you need to don't give in to provocations and don't extension theirs.
You don't need to step the law. You need to have a clear mind and understand the situation.
Second, you mustn't game on the rules of troublemakers.
You need to seek and rollover situation and discovery decision a problem in the border of law.
You mustn't dispute with him. You mustn't allege your truth and need to find common ground.
