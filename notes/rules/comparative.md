>After comparatives you can use **than:**

**Before comparatives you can use:**
- much
- a lot
- far (= a lot)
- a bit
- a little
- slightly (= a little)

**Examples:**
- Let's go by car. It's **much cheaper**. (or **a lot cheaper**)
- "How do you feel?" "**Much better**, thanks."
- Don't go by train. It's **a lot more expensive**. (or **much more expensive**)
- Could you speak **a bit more slowly**? (or **a little more slowly**)
- This bag is **slightly heavier** than the other one.
- Her illness was **far more serious** than we thought at first. (or **much more serious / a bit more serious**)

You can use **any** and **no** + comparative (**any longer / no bigger** etc.):
- I've waited long enough. I'm not waiting **any longer**. (= not even a little longer)
- We expected their house to be very big, but it's no bigger than ours. or ... it isn't **any bigger** than ours. (= not even a little bigger)
- How do you feel now? Do you feel **any better**?
- This hotel is better than the other one, and it's **no more expensive**.
  
We repeat comparatives (**better and better** etc.) to say that something changes continuously:
- Your English is improving. It's getting **better and better**.
- The city is growing fast. It's getting **bigger and bigger**.
- Cathy got **more and more bored** in her job. In the end she left.
- These days **more and more** people are learning English.
  
You can say **the** (sooner/bigger/more etc.) **the better**:
- "What time shall we leave?" "The sooner the better." (= as soon as possible)
- What sort of box do you want? A big one?
 Yes, the bigger the better. (= as big as possible)
- When you're travelling, the less luggage you have the better.
  
We also use **the ... the ...** to say that one thing depends on another thing:
- The warmer the weather, the better I feel. (= if the weather is warmer, I feel better)
- The sooner we leave, the earlier we will arrive.
- The younger you are, the easier it is to learn.
- The more expensive the hotel, the better the service.
- The more electricity you use, the higher your bill will be.
- The more I thought about the plan, the less I liked it.


You can use elder (or older) when you talk about people in a family. You can say (my/your etc.) elder sister/brother/daughter/son:
-  My elder sister is a TV producer. (or My older sister ...)
-  David looks older than he really is.
-  My sister is older than me. (not elder than me)

Some more examples of **not as ... (as)**:
- Richard **isn't as old as** he looks. (= he looks older than he is)

- I **don't** know **as many** people **as** you do. (= you know more people)
- "How much did it cost? Fifty pounds?" "No, **not as much as** that." (= less than fifty pounds)

You can also say **not so ... (as)**:
- It's not warm, but it isn't so cold as yesterday. (= it isn't as cold as ...)

**Less ... than** is similar to **not as ... as**:
- I spent **less money than** you. (= I **didn't** spend **as much money as** you)
- The city centre was **less crowded than** usual. (= it **wasn't as crowded as** usual)
