# go, play, do

- Play is generally used with team sports and those sports that need a ball or similar object (puck, disc, shuttlecock...). Also, those activities in which two people or teams compete against each other: play football, play poker, play chess.  

- Go is used with activities and sports that end in -ing. The verb go here implies that we go somewhere to practise this sport: go swimming.
   
- Do is used with recreational activities and with individual, non-team sports or sports in which a ball is not used, like martial arts, for example: do a crossword/puzzle, do athletics, do karate.
Some exceptions to the rules:

â€” You use do with two activities that end in -ing: do boxing and do body-building, because they don't imply moving along as the other activities ending in -ing.
