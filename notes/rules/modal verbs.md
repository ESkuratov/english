# Modal verbs
**Should** is used to give advice to someone.  
**Have to and must** are both used to express obligation. There is a slight difference between the way they are used.  
**Have to** shows us that the obligation comes from somebody else. It's a law or a rule, and the speaker can't change it.  
**Must** shows us that the obligation comes from the speaker. It isn't a law or a rule.  
We use **need to** to say that something is necessary or important.  
We use **mustn't/must not** to say that something is forbidden or a bad idea.  
We use **don't have to/didn't have to/needn't/don't need to** to show that there is no obligation. You can do something if you want to, but it's not compulsory.  
We use **must** to give strong advice.
