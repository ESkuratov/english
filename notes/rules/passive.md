# Passive

**Compare active and passive:**
- Somebody built this house(object) in 1981. (active)
- This house(subject) was built in 1981. (passive)

When we use an active verb, we say what the subject does.
When we use a passive verb, we say what happens to the subject.
  

**When we use the passive, who or what causes the action is often unknown or unimportant:**
- A lot of money **was stolen** in the robbery. (somebody stole it, but we don't know' who)
- Is this room **cleaned** every day? (does somebody clean it? — it's not important who)
  
**If we want to say who does or what causes the action, we use by...**
- This house was built by my grandfather.
- Two hundred people are employed by the company.
