# Past continuous

I was doing something = I was in the middle of doing something at a certain time.  
The action or situation had already started before this time, but had not finished:  
* This time last year I was living in Brazil.
* What were you doing at 10 o'clock last night?
* I waved to Helen, but she wasn't looking.

  
We often use the past simple and the past continuous together to say that something happened in the middle of something else:  
* I was walking home when I met Dave. (in the middle of an action)
* Kate was watching television when we arrived."
* Matt phoned while we were having dinner.
* It was raining when I got up.
* I saw you in the park yesterday. You were sitting on the grass and reading a book.
* I hurt my back while I was working in the garden.


But we use the past simple to say that one thing happened after another:
* I was walking along the road when I saw Dave. So I stopped, and we had a chat.
* When Karen arrived, we were having dinner. (= we had already started before she arrived)
* When Karen arrived, we had dinner. (= Karen arrived, and then we had dinner)

Some verbs (for example, know and want) are not normally used in the continuous:
* We were good friends. We knew each other well. (not We were knowing)
* I was enjoying the party, but Chris wanted to go home. (not was wanting)
