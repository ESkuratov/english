to search for something — to try to find
to long for something — to want something very much
a void - a feeling of unhappiness because someone or something is missing
hardcore - extreme
tryna - trying to
to go off the deep end — to lose control; to become crazy
to crash — to break noisily
a surface — the top part or layer of something
far from — not at all


Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself


Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?


I'm fallin
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself


I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now


In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now


Hoo, huh, uh, huhh-ow
Huh, huhh-huhhh

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface
Where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
