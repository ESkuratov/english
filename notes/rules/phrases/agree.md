## Agree With

We agree with a person if we have the same opinion as that person.  

* My teacher says reading is very important, and I agree with her.
* I don’t agree with my relatives when it comes to politics.  
  
We can also agree with / disagree with a statement, a decision, an article, an opinion, an idea, or another form of communication or position:  

* This is a well-researched book, and I agree with most of the points in it.
* My parents support that politician because they agree with her stance on the economy.


## Agree On / About

We agree on or about a topic or plan. Here are some examples:

* Everyone on the team agreed on a date for the meeting.
* My husband and I agree about the best way to educate our kids.
* The students need to agree on how to do the project.
* We can be friends even if we don’t agree about everything.

Note the difference – we agree on/about a topic; we agree with someone’s opinion/statement on a topic.

Take a look at these two examples – let’s say I’m a vegetarian, and my sister is not.  

* My sister and I don’t agree about the ethics of eating meat.
* I don’t agree with my sister’s opinions about eating meat.

## Agree That 

Agree that is followed by the thing that we agree on.

The difference from the previous example is that agree on/about is followed by a noun or a question word (agree on politics, agree about where to have the party), whereas agree that is followed by a subject + verb, or the -ING form of the verb:

* He agreed that it was a great movie.
* I agree that saving 10% of your salary is a good idea.
* She agrees that we should clean the house more often.
* Doctors agree that washing your hands helps keep you healthy.

## Agree To 

We agree to do an action – so agree to is followed by a verb – and this means you promise to do the action:

* I agreed to give them a ride home from work.
* We all agreed to meet up at 8:00.
* He’s so lazy; he never agrees to help out.
* I lent her money and she agreed to pay me back tomorrow.

We can also agree to the terms of a contract; this means we consent to it, we accept it:
* Hey, I never agreed to this price increase!
   
## What To Say After “Agree”:
So let’s review:

* Agree with a person: Everyone agrees with me
* Agree with a statement/idea/opinion: I agree with his perspective.
* Agree on/about a topic: We agree on the best course of action.
* Agree that something is true/good: They agree that an apology is necessary.
* Agree to do something: She agreed to help me study for the test.

## Don’t Say “I’m Agree”
One final tip: never say “I’m agree” – that’s incorrect.

Always say “I agree” and then use one of the words you learned in this lesson – agree with, agree on/about, agree that, agree to.
