### GET = OBTAIN

A second meaning of get is to obtain. This is a little different from receive – when you receive something, you made no effort – someone else gave it to you. If you get a gift for your birthday, you didn’t do anything to receive it. But when you obtain something, you put in some effort.

### GET = BUY
Get can also mean to buy.

- get tickets to a concert 
- Where did you get that shirt? - meaning where did you buy it
- get something for a good price
- get a bargain on something 
  -  both of which mean to pay a fair or small amount of money compared to the high value you receive.

  - meaning you want to order, you want to buy that food/drink item

### GET = BRING
We also use get in the sense of bring. 

- Can you get me an extra blanket? - meaning can you bring it to me.
- go get -  when someone needs to go somewhere in order to bring back an item

Let’s say there’s a meeting at work, and there aren’t enough chairs in the meeting room – then, my assistant could **go get more chairs**, meaning she will go and then bring the chairs.

I’ll go get the first aid kit! - meaning you’ll bring it.


### GET = ARRIVE
Informally, we use “get” to mean arrive. For example: I usually get home from work around 6:00 – meaning arrive at home.

You can use “get” when talking about arriving from travel – If we take the next available flight, we’ll get to New York on Monday morning.

When asking for directions, you could say “How can I get to the train station?” – how can I go there, how can I arrive there.


### GET = BECOME
Get also means become. You can get angry, get excited, get tired, get sick, get older, and get lost.

Something can get better or get worse, meaning it is becoming better or worse.

We also use it for changes in marital status: two people can get engaged (meaning they plan to marry each other), get married, and get divorced.

You can also get dressed, meaning to put on your clothes, and get ready, meaning to prepare yourself. When you get drunk it means you become intoxicated with too much alcohol, and when you get used to something it means you become accustomed to it.

All these expressions use “get” in the sense of becoming, changing status.

### GET = UNDERSTAND (INFORMAL)
Another informal use of “get” is to understand. If you say “I don’t get it,” it means “I don’t understand.”

You can also say “I don’t get…” followed by a question word and the topic you don’t understand, for example:

I don’t get why they broke up; they seemed to have a perfect relationship.
I don’t get how to use this computer program.
Or if someone tells a joke, and you didn’t understand what’s funny about it, you could say you didn’t get the joke.

If you get to do something, it means you have a good/special opportunity, for example:

If my kids finish all their homework, they get to watch a movie before bed.
He’s upset because he didn’t get to take a vacation last year.


### HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING = HAVE AN OBLIGATION; SHOULD DO IT
On the other hand, if you have got to do something, it means you need to do it, you have an obligation to do it, or you should do it. This typically sounds like “gotta” in informal spoken English. Here are some examples of “gotta” referring to obligations:

I’ve gotta pick up my kids from school.
If you borrow books from the library, you’ve gotta return them.
That movie is awesome – you’ve gotta see it! (you should, a strong recommendation)

### GET SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING = PERSUADE/CONVINCE THE PERSON TO DO IT
When you get someone to do something, it means you persuade/convince the person to do it.

After a lot of discussion, I finally got him to agree with me.
It’s hard to get my kids to help with housework.


### GET SOMETHING DONE = CAUSE IT TO HAPPEN
Finally, when you get something done, it means you make or cause it to happen. Sometimes this means doing it yourself, and other times it means you cause someone else to do it for you. For example:

I like to get all my housework done by noon. (This means I finished it myself)
My car has broken down – I need to get it fixed. (This means I will probably take it to a mechanic and they will fix it)
