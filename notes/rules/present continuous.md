# Present continuous
You can use the present continuous with today / this week / this year etc. (periods around now):
* a: You’re working hard today. (not You work hard today)
* b: Yes,I have a lot to do.
* The company I work for isn’t doing so well this year.


We use the continuous for things happening at or around the time of speaking.
The action is not complete.

**I always do (something) = I do it every time:**
- I always go to work by car. (not I'm always going)

**"I'm always doing something" has a different meaning. For example:**
- I'm always losing things = I lose things very often, perhaps too often, or more often than normal.
- You're always watching television. You should do something more active. (= You watch television too often)
- Tim is never satisfied. He's always complaining. (= He complains too much)

**When think means "believe" or "have an opinion", we do not use the continuous:**
- I think Mary is Canadian, but I'm not sure. (not I'm thinking)
- What do you think about my plan? (= What is your opinion?)   

**When think means "consider", the continuous is possible:**
- I'm thinking about what happened. I often think about it.
- Nicky is thinking of giving up her job. (= she is considering it)
	
**We use am/is/are being to say how somebody is behaving. It is not usually possible in other sentences:**	
- I can't understand why he's being so selfish. He isn't usually like that. (being selfish = behaving selfishly at the moment)
	
**When think means "believe" or "have an opinion", we do not use the continuous:**

## Present Tenses for the Future

I’m doing something (tomorrow) = I have already decided and arranged to do it:
- What **are you doing** on Saturday evening? (not What do you do). **I’m going** to the theatre. (not I go)
- What time **is Cathy arriving** tomorrow? Half past ten. **I’m meeting** her at the station.
- I’m not working tomorrow, so we can go out somewhere.
- Ian isn’t playing football next Saturday. He’s hurt his leg.


"I’m going to (do)" is also possible in these sentences:
- What are you going to do on Saturday evening?

But present continuous is more natural for arrangements.
Do not use will to talk about what you have arranged to do:

- What are you doing this evening? (not What will you do)
- Alex is getting married next month. (not will get)

You can also use present continuous for an action just before you begin to do it. This happens especially with verbs of movement (go / come / leave etc.):
- I’m tired. I’m going to bed now. Goodnight. (not I go to bed now)
- "Tina, are you ready yet?"   "Yes, I’m coming." (not I come)


But present continuous is more usual for personal arrangements:
- What time are you meeting Ann tomorrow? (not do you meet)
