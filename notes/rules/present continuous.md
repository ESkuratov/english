# Present continuous
You can use the present continuous with today / this week / this year etc. (periods around now):
* a: You’re working hard today. (not You work hard today)
* b: Yes,I have a lot to do.
* The company I work for isn’t doing so well this year.


We use the continuous for things happening at or around the time of speaking.
The action is not complete.

**I always do (something) = I do it every time:**
- I always go to work by car. (not I'm always going)

**"I'm always doing something" has a different meaning. For example:**
- I'm always losing things = I lose things very often, perhaps too often, or more often than normal.
- You're always watching television. You should do something more active. (= You watch television too often)
- Tim is never satisfied. He's always complaining. (= He complains too much)
