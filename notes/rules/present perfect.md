# Present perfect 

**When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now:**
* Is Sally here? No, she's gone out. (= she is out now)
* Where's your key? I don't know. I've lost it. (= I don't have it now)
* He told me his name, but I've forgotten it. (= I can't remember it now)
* I can't find my bag. Have you seen it? (= Do you know where it is now)
* Sam has cleaned his room. (=The room is clean now).
* Jake has told Kate about the party. (=Now Kate knows about the party)

**When we say that "something has happened", this is usually new information:**
* Ow! I've cut my finger.
* The road is closed. There has been an accident. 
* (from the news) Police have arrested two men in connection with the robbery.
* Don is having a driving lesson. It's his first one.
* It's the first time he has driven a car.
* or He has never driven a car before."
* Bill is phoning his girlfriend again. That's the third time he's phoned her this evening.
