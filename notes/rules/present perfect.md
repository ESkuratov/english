# Present perfect 

**When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now:**
* Is Sally here? No, she's gone out. (= she is out now)
* Where's your key? I don't know. I've lost it. (= I don't have it now)
* He told me his name, but I've forgotten it. (= I can't remember it now)
* I can't find my bag. Have you seen it? (= Do you know where it is now)
* Sam has cleaned his room. (=The room is clean now).
* Jake has told Kate about the party. (=Now Kate knows about the party)

**Been (to)** = visited:  
I've never been to China. Have you been there?

In the following examples too, the speakers are talking about a period that continues until now (**recently / in the last few days / so far / since breakfast etc.**):
* **Have** you **heard** from Brian recently?
* **I've met** a lot of people in the last few days.
* Everything is going well. We **haven't had** any problems so far.
* I'm hungry. I **haven't eaten** anything **since breakfast**. ( = from breakfast until now)
* It's good to see you again. We **haven't seen** each other **for a long time**.

We use the present perfect with **today / this evening / this year** etc. when these periods are not finished at the time of speaking:
* I've drunk four cups of coffee today.
* Have you had a holiday this year (yet)?
* I haven't seen Tom this morning. Have you? (it's still morning)
* Rob hasn't studied very hard this term.

We say: It's the (first) time something **has happened**. For example:
* Don is having a driving lesson. It's his first one.
* It's the first time he has driven a car. or He has never driven a car before.
* Sarah has lost her passport again. This is the second time this has happened.
* Bill is phoning his girlfriend again. That's the third time he's phoned her this evening.


**When we say that "something has happened", this is usually new information:**
* Ow! I've cut my finger.
* The road is closed. There has been an accident. 
* (from the news) Police have arrested two men in connection with the robbery.
* Don is having a driving lesson. It's his first one.
* It's the first time he has driven a car.
* or He has never driven a car before."
* Bill is phoning his girlfriend again. That's the third time he's phoned her this evening.

# How long

**I have known/had/lived etc.** is the present perfect simple.  
**I have been learning / been waiting / been doing etc.** is the present perfect continuous.

> We use for and since to say how long something has been happening.

**We use for + a period of time (two hours, six weeks etc.):**
- I've been waiting for two hours.
- Sally has been working here for six months. (not since six months)
- I haven't seen Tom for three days. (not since three days)

**We use since + the start of a period (8 o'clock, Monday, 1999 etc.):**
- I've been waiting since 8 o'clock.
- Sally has been working here since April. (= from April until now)
- I haven't seen Tom since Monday. (= from Monday until now)

**We say "It's (a long time / two years etc.) since something happened":**
 - It's two years since I last saw Joe. (= I haven't seen Joe for two years)
 - It's ages since we went to the cinema. (= We haven't been to the cinema for ages)

**You can ask "How long is it since...?":**
- How long is it since you last saw Joe? (= When did you last see Joe?)
- How long is it since Mrs Hill died? (= When did Mrs Hill die?)

**You can also say "It's been (= It has been)... since... ":**
- It's been two years since I last saw Joe.
