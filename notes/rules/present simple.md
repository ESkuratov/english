Present simple (I do) with a future meaning

We use present simple when we talk about timetables, programmes etc. (for public transport, cinemas etc.):

- My train leaves at 11.30, so I need to be at the station by 11.15.
- What time does the film begin this evening?
- Itâ€™s Wednesday tomorrow. / Tomorrow is Wednesday.

You can use present simple to talk about people if their plans are fixed like a timetable:

- What time do you finish work tomorrow?
